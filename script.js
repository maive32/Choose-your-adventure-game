He hands you the flower, you put it in your pocket, "It's a Gladiolus, they represent strength of character; whenever you feel afraid, just hold on to it."

As the end of the hall approaches, you see your last picture together; you both seem to hate the other's presence. In the living room, you spot a myriad of spider-like crawlies on the floor. They scutter away into the darkness in a pattern that seems like locks of hair, entangling a dark blueish figure who slowly walks away from the shadows. It's your sister, some deformed version of her with a twisted neck, hollow eyes and mouth; her arms reach out to you and you show them away, she yells "Sunny, why did you push me?", before grabbing your garden shears from your pocket and puncturing through.

You open the door and it's your best friend, Basil. He asks where you've been, that you've been gone for weeks and that he was worried. "Anyway, are you okay Sunny?" he asks. Your eyes swell up and you hug him tightly, he reassures rubbing your back. "C'mon let's go to my garden.", he leads you by your hand. You escaped headspace, finally you're able to smile.`,
