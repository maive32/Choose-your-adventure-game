He hands you the flower, you put it in your pocket, "It's a Gladiolus, they represent strength of character; whenever you feel afraid, just hold on to it."

As the end of the hall approaches, you see your last picture together; you both seem to hate the other's presence. In the living room, you spot a myriad of spider-like crawlies on the floor. They scutter away into the darkness in a pattern that seems like locks of hair, entangling a dark blueish figure who slowly walks away from the shadows. It's your sister, some deformed version of her with a twisted neck, hollow eyes and mouth; her arms reach out to you and you show them away, she yells "Sunny, why did you push me?", before grabbing your garden shears from your pocket and puncturing through. You feel your body grow limp, looking at her with sadness in your eyes, the last words you are able to muster is "I'm sorry...". You wake up in a cold sweat, breathing heavily.

You open the door and it's your best friend, Basil. He asks where you've been, that you've been gone for weeks and that he was worried. "Anyway, are you okay Sunny?" he asks.

Stepping through the tear, you look around and see more footprints, you decide to follow the footprints. The forest wwas covered in webbing, and became thicker the more you traveled towards the church. In the middle of the path was a black figure with 4 legs and a single eye on its head.
